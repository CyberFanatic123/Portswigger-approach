- Occur when website process requests concurrently without adequate safeguards.
- Timed requests is used to cause intentional collisions and exploit this unintended behavior for malicious purposes.

**Race window** - period of time during which a collision is possible

Impact heavily depend on the application and  the specific functionality in which it occurs

Variations of this kind of attack, including:
1. Redeeming a gift card multiple times
2. Rating a product multiple times
3. Withdrawing or transferring cash in excess of your account balance
4. Reusing a single CAPTCHA solution
5. Bypassing an anti-brute-force rate limit

Limit overruns are a subtype of so-called "time-of-check to time-of-use" (TOCTOU) flaws.


# Lab: Limit overrun race conditions
- Add the product to cart and intercept the api that applies the discount code. [PROMO20]
- Send it multiple times to repeater.
- Now group all those request into one and send the request through  single packet attack (parallel) [single packet attack because of HTTP/2 ]

- As the result of the above attack the  discount code is applied multiple times.

# Lab: Bypassing rate limits via race conditions

## Approach 1 (using Turbo Intruder)
To use the single-packet attack in Turbo Intruder:

1. Ensure that the target supports HTTP/2. The single-packet attack is incompatible with HTTP/1.
2. Set the `engine=Engine.BURP2` and `concurrentConnections=1` configuration options for the request engine.
3. When queueing your requests, group them by assigning them to a named gate using the `gate` argument for the `engine.queue()` method.
4. To send all of the requests in a given group, open the respective gate with the `engine.openGate()` method.

```
def queueRequests(target, wordlists): 
		engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint, 
					concurrentConnections=1, 
					engine=Engine.BURP2 
					) 

		# queue 20 requests in gate '1' 
		for i in range(20): 
			engine.queue(target.req, gate='1') 

		# send all requests in gate '1' in parallel 
		engine.openGate('1')
```


## Approach 2 (using Intruder)

- Send the request to intruder

- Copy the payload to payloads section and note the count of the payload [30]
![[Pasted image 20240521115752.png]]

- In resource pool, create a new resource pool with maximum concurrent requests as [30] the same count as number of payloads, and start the attack.

# Lab: Multi-endpoint race conditions

- Send  the POST request to change email, twice
![[Pasted image 20240521142903.png]]

- Update the email that is not allowed in second request and it will update successfully.
